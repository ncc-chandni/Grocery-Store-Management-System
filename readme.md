ðŸ“Œ Grocery Store Management System â€“ A Full-Stack Data-Driven Application
ðŸ›’ The Challenge:
Managing a grocery store involves tracking inventory, processing sales, and handling customers efficiently. Many small and mid-sized stores still rely on manual processes, leading to errors, inefficiencies, and lost revenue. I set out to build a scalable, data-driven solution to streamline store operations.

ðŸš€ The Solution:
I developed a 3-tier Grocery Store Management System that seamlessly integrates frontend, backend, and database layers to provide an interactive, user-friendly experience.

âœ” Frontend (User Interface): Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, ensuring a clean, responsive design for store employees and managers.
âœ” Backend (Business Logic): Powered by Python and Flask, enabling secure transactions, inventory management, and real-time updates.
âœ” Database (Data Storage): Utilizes MySQL to efficiently handle product inventory, sales records, and customer details.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features & Impact:
âœ… Intuitive Dashboard â€“ Easy-to-use interface for managing inventory and sales.
âœ… Real-Time Data Handling â€“ Tracks stock levels and transactions seamlessly.
âœ… Secure & Scalable Architecture â€“ Designed to handle growing business needs.
âœ… Role-Based Access â€“ Restricts permissions for admin, employees, and customers.
âœ… Automated Reporting â€“ Generates reports on sales trends, revenue, and stock alerts.

ðŸ”— Tech Stack: Python | Flask | MySQL | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Bootstrap

This project showcases my ability to build full-stack applications, manage databases, and create interactive dashboardsâ€”bridging the gap between business needs and technology solutions.

ðŸš€ Next Steps: Looking to expand this system by integrating Power BI for advanced data visualization and adding AI-driven demand forecasting for better inventory management.

# python_projects_grocery_webapp
In this python project, we will build a grocery store management application. It will be 3 tier application,
1. Front end: UI is written in HTML/CSS/Javascript/Bootstrap
2. Backend: Python and Flask
3. Database: mysql

   
### Installation Instructions

Download mysql for windows: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

`pip install mysql-connector-python`

###  Modules

The grocery management system that we built has three important modules
1. **Database Design** : In this database module, we , 1) Brainstorm and design database schema 2) Create database in mysql, assign primary keys etc 3) Develop foreign key constrains 4) Insert sample records in database
2. **Products Module**: In this products module, we , 1) Build a backend code for products management 2) Write code to run SQL queries in python using mysql connector
3. **Orders Module**: In this orders module, we , 1) Build a front end or UI code for products management 2) Write python flask server that connects front end with backend 3) Complete products module where one can list all current products, add and delete a product
